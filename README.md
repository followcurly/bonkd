# Bonkd Chrome Extension

**Why use many words when few words do trick?**

Transform complex articles, news, and web content into easy-to-read text with one click.

## The Premise

Is technology making us dumber? Are our brains turning to mush from endless scrolling and information overload? I wrote an article about this, called **[The Cognitive Downgrade](https://followcurly.substack.com/p/the-cognitive-downgrade)**, that explores this very question.

This extension is my sarcastic, semi-dystopian solution to the problem. If we're all becoming illiterate, we might as well have the tools to deal with it.
